# Omar Carrillo's - Portfolio in React

A portfolio project I started after graduating from University of Illinois at Chicago with a Bachelor's in Engineering with a Major in Computer Science/
With experience in HTML/CSS/JS projects from my time in school I wanted to create something interesting and polished in React. It includes information about myself and the ability to contact me.

## Project - CTA Ridership (In Progress)

Having worked with the CTA Ridership database for ride data for 2021 for previous projects using just SQL and Python I wanted to make an interactive and easy to use application to request and view the ridership data in a digestible manner. 

## Guides I found helpful while working on this

### React Portfolio Tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI
This tutorial by freecodecamp helped me stay on track when making an application and React with routing and provided the basis for the styling I did 
for the project. 

Very cool animations done in React in there too!

### React Leaflet Tutorial for Beginners (2023) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD6813wGdBA&t=648s

Helpful tutorial for using Leaflet for maps in JS applications that I used for the CTA Ridership portion of the project.
